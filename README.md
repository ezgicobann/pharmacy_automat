I am developing a project for a facial recognition-enabled pharmacy vending machine. The aim of this project is to create a vending machine that will facilitate patients' access to medication. This vending machine will enable patients to easily obtain their medication outside of pharmacy hours or in situations where they have difficulty visiting the pharmacy.
